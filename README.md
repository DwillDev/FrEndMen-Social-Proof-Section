## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

During this project, I learned how to use the transform() element to remove items from their flow and create a more decorative look. I also learned the importance of starting fromt he top of the page instead of doing various things at once, as I was more critical of my code and felt that it was sloppier and ended up redoing the project. I am far happier with my work, though it took me longer than if I went with my previous attempt.

### Continued development

As I have finished all the newbie css & html projects, I plan to start learning Javascript and implimenting it in future webpage projects, which I am excited about.

### Useful resources

- [MDN Docs' Transform Page](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/transform) - This helped me as a refresher on the various transform properties so that I was better able to implement them into my project.
